# Decimal-To-Binary

Two's Complement is a mathematical operation on binary numbers, as well as a binary signed number representation based on this operation. Its wide use in computing makes it the most important example of a radix complement.

In an 8-bit Two's Complement system, the positive numbers from 0 to 127 are represented as usual in binary form (00000000 to 01111111). The negative numbers from -1 to -128 are represented as the two's complement of their absolute values.

The Two's Complement of a binary number is calculated by inverting all the bits and then adding 1 (binary addition) to the result. For example, to get the Two's Complement of -5 , we first write 5 in binary (00000101), then we invert the bits (11111010), and finally we add 1 (11111011). So, -5 is represented as 11111011 in an 8-bit two's complement system.

You are required to modify your previous code to find the 8-bit Two's Complement representation of a number if the given number is negative. The input number will be a signed integer ranging from -128 to 127.

Your contract must implement the following public functions:
 

Input:
toBinary(int n) returns (string) : This function takes integer as input and converts the input number to its 8-bit binary representation, and return the binary representation as a string.
